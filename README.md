# Train-Tracker

## Project

* This project is an arrival board for trains that users can add, using firebase to store train data

* Users add the following details:
    1. Train Name
    2. Train Destination
    3. First Arrival Time
    4. Frequency of Arrivals

* Then, the webpage will update showing the Train's name, destination, arrival frequency, next arrival time, and how many minutes until the train arrives.

* This Project was made and maintained by Joe Keegan
